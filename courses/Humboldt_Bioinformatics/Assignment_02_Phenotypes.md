Maps from mendelian phenotypes  
1. In a Two-point cross we take a hetrozygous animal and cross it with a homozygous animal.  
a) Draw the mendelian inheritance diagram for two traits in an AaBb x aabb cross  
b) Why don’t we take two hetrozygous animals ?  
2. In a three point cross AaBbCc x aabbcc,  
a) Draw the mendelian inheritance diagram for three traits in an AaBbCc x aabbcc cross  
b) How many different gametes can be produced by the AaBbCc parent ?
