#### Classic Phenotypes (Traits)

Traits:
- Yield
- Flowering time
- Human stature

Used as markers during breeding.  

Example Bos taurus (cows):
- Some bred for milk (Holstein Friesian),
- Some bred for meat (Angus, Waygu).  

Example Solanum tuberosum (potato):
- White flowers, breed for human consumption.
- Purple flowers, breed to make starch.

Qualitative properties, observed but not generally numerically measurable, for example taste. Subjective  
Quantitive properties, have a magnitute or multitude. SI units.  

Mendelian: (Gregor Mendel)  
- One genetic locus (gene) controlling a trait.

Complex:  
- Two or more genetic loci controlling a trait.
