#### Classic Phenotypes (Traits)

Traits:
- Yield
- Flowering time
- Human stature

Used as markers during breeding.  

Example Bos taurus (cows):
- Some bred for milk (Holstein Friesian),
- Some bred for meat (Angus, Waygu).  

Example Solanum tuberosum (potato):
- White flowers, breed for human consumption.
- Purple flowers, breed to make starch.

Qualitative properties, observed but not generally numerically measurable, for example taste. Subjective  
Quantitive properties, have a magnitute or multitude. SI units.  

Mendelian: (Gregor Mendel)  
- One genetic locus (gene) controlling a trait.

Complex:  
- Two or more genetic loci controlling a trait.

Mendelian Examples:
- [ABCC11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC11) Ear wax, dry or wet
- Albinism
- Brachydactyly
- [TAS2R38](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAS2R38)  Phenylthiocarbamide, tastless or bitter


#### Punnett Square

Determine the probability of an offspring having a particular genotype.

Additive vs Dominant phenotype  

We can map Mendelian phenotypes back to the genome by measuring traits in parents and offspring and calculate the distance (co-occurance) between phenotypes.

[Centimorgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimorgan)  
[Genetic linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_linkage) is the tendency of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together.  

[Drosophila melanogaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster) Thomas Hunt Morgan began using fruit flies in experimental studies of heredity at Columbia University in 1910.  

Homozygous:  
- Identical alleles of the gene are present on both homologous chromosomes.  

Heterozygous:  
- Cells contain two different alleles of a gene.

Hemizygous:  
- Only one copy is present (or when one copy of a gene is deleted).
