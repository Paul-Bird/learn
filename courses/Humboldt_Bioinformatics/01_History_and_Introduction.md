#### What does a Bioinformatician do ?

Typically in a biology group, collect data in wet lab, and process that data.  
Minority work just on the advancement of data processing.  

Definitions:  
- In silico - can be tested on a computer (compared to in vivo / in vitro)

#### History of Bioinformatics

1972 [Walter Fiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Fiers) first to to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene.  
1976 [Bacteriophage MS2 RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage_MS2) sequenced.  
1977 [Frederick Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Sanger) [Î¦X174 first DNA sequenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_X_174) 5,386 nucleotides [Sanger sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing)  
1981 [cauliflower mosaic virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauliflower_mosaic_virus) sequenced using [Shotgun sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_sequencing)  
1987 Collection of distinct DNAs in arrays for expression profiling was first described. [DNA Microarray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_microarray)  
1995 [Haemophilus influenzae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilus_influenzae) the first free-living microorganism to have its entire genome sequenced.  
2003 Human genome project completed  
2010 [ENCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENCODE)  

Sequence of RNA, DNA and proteins are the fundamental data types and alignment is the fundamental algorithm of bioinformatics.  

[Electropherogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electropherogram) - graph that displays the raw data obtained from sequencing your DNA.
