#### Origins of Life on Earth

Billion Years
4.5     Earth formed
4.2     A stable hydrosphere established
4.2-4.0 Prebiotic (no replicating organisms)
4.0     Pre-RNA
3.8     RNA
3.7-3.5 First Prokaryotes evolve "Cyanobacteria"

Compartmentalisation of structures using lipid bilayers critical to the evolution.

1.5     First unicellular Eukaryotes evolve
0.5     Multicellular life emerges

#### Human Genome

First publishd in 2001, 3 billion base pairs, across humankind, approx 0.1% diversity in the genome.  

Genome can be used as a molecular clock, after species divergence, genetic mutations accumulate at a fairly uniform rate.
[Bayesian molecular clock dating of species divergences in the genomics era](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2015.8.pdf)  

Only about 1.5% of the human genome is coding for proteins.  

1953 DNA double helix structure understood.  
1961 Genetic code is cracked.  
1977 Initial processes for the precise sequence of bases ATCG.  
1986 First semi-automated DNA sequencer.  
1990 Human genome project begins.  
2001 First draft Human genome publishd.  
2008 [1000 Genomes Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Genomes_Project) launched.  
2010 Sequence a single strand of dsDNA.  
2010 [Synthetic Organism](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703559004575256470152341984)  
2016 [Human Cell Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Cell_Atlas)  

Each human cell has 1.8m of DNA wound on histones, protein that provides structural support for a chromosome.  

[Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2008](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2008/summary/) "for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP". Allow study of live systems in real time.  

Biology is dynamic, [Neutrophil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil) most abundant type of white blood cell, can chase after bacterium. [film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_xh-bkiv_c)
