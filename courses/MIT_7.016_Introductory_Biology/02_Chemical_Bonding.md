#### Composition of Living Systems 

Approximately 70% water.  
Rest is mostly Macromolecules with some ions / small molecules.  

Macromolecules:  
55% Proteins  
25% Carbohydrates  
10% Nucleic acids  
5% Lipids - membrane bilayer  

Elements (98% of molecular mass):
- Hydrogen
- Carbon
- Nitrogen
- Oxygen
- Phosphorus
- Sulfur

#### Chemical Bonding

##### Covalent

Carbon $2s^22p^2$
Nitrogen $2s^22p^3$
Oxygen $2s^22p^4$

$CH_4$ Methane Neutral  
$NH_3$ Ammonia Neutral  
$NH_4^+$ Ammonium Positive  
$OH^-$ Hydroxide Negative  
$H_2O$ Water Neutral  
$H_3O^+$ Hydronium Positive  
  

Carbon is neutral when it has 4 covalent bonds.  
Nitrogen is neutral when it has 3 covalent bonds, 1 lone pair.  
Oxygen is neutral when it has 2 covalent bonds, 2 lone pairs.  

Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus and Sulpur like to make covalent bonds.

In Biology normally [pH7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH)

Side chain of [Lysine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine) has $NH_2$ at the end of a carbon chain is most commonly [protonated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protonation) with a positive charge.  

In most biological molecules Sulfur copies oxygen.

$H_2S$ Hydrogen sulfide  

Phosphorus in [Phosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate) form essential for life.  

$H_3PO_4$ [Phosphoric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_acid)  

$C_{10}H_{16}N_5O_{13}P_3 $ [Adenosine triphosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate)

[Organophosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organophosphate) also known as phosphate esters.  

[Condensation reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_reaction) a chemical reaction where two molecules combine releasing a small molecule such as water.
