### What Makes Healthcare Unique ?

#### History of AI and ML in Healthcare

1970's MYCIN expert system - identify bacteria  

1980's Internist-1/QMR model - diagnosis for internal medicine  
- 570 disease variables, 4075 symptom variables, 45,470 directed edges.  
- Knowledge from doctors, 15 person years work, no machine learning.  
- Difficult to maintain, prior probabilities for disease different with geographies, new medicine.  

1980's RX Project: Automating Medical Discovery.  

1990's 88 published studies using neural networks.
- Small number of features.  
- Limited training data.  
- Poor generalisation.  

#### Data

Adoption of electronic health records (USA) from 9% in 2008 to ~ 80% opportunity for deep learning.

> [MIMIC Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/)
> 40k ICU patients, monitoring data, medication, outcomes.

##### Types of Medical Data
