#### Problem 1 [12 points] 
Define a 3-chain to be a (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence of three integers, which is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing. We will show here that any sequence of five distinct integers will contain a 3-chain. Write the sequence as a1, a2, a3, a4, a5. Note that a monotonically increasing sequences is one in which each term is greater than or equal to the previous term. Similarly, a monotonically decreasing sequence is one in which each term is less than or equal to the previous term. Lastly, a subsequence is a sequence derived from the original sequence by deleting some elements without changing the location of the remaining elements.

(a) [4 pts] Assume that a1 < a2. Show that if there is no 3-chain in our sequence, then a3 must be less than a1. (Hint: consider a4!)

(b) [2 pts] Using the previous part, show that if a1 < a2 and there is no 3-chain in our sequence, then a3 < a4 < a2.
