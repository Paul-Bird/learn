#### Polarity

A water molecule has an unequal charge distribution.  

Partial charge.

Oxygen is electronegative, it exerts a strong attraction for the electrons it shares with the hydrogen atoms.

The electrons spend more time around the oxygen, the oxygen has partial negative charge.

As the electrons spend less time around the hydrogens they get a partial positive charge.

The partial negative from the oxygen in one water molecule is attracted to the partial positive charge in the hydrogen of another water molecule.  

This hydrogen bond is a weak bond, non-covalent.  

H-Bonds for example hold DNA together and used in enzyme function.

Not all molecules are polar, for example $CO_2$  

Water molecule can make 4 possible H-Bonds, one from each hydrogen and two from the oxygen.  

These 4 H-Bonds are what gives ice it's crystaline structure.
