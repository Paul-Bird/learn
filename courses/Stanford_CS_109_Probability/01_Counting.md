### AI History

Two Big Ideas

1. Artificial Neuron a probability unit configured with weights. Join very many together in layers.
2. Learn by example, how to set useful weights in the artificial neurons.

Open Problem: One Shot Learning

### Example of probability

A patient has a positive zika test.
0.8% of population have zika.
90% positive rate for people with zika
7% false positive rate 

P(zika|positive test) = 9%

### Counting

- Role a dice 6 outcomes {1,2,3,4,5,6}
- Role even only 3 outcomes {2,4,6}
- Role two dice 36 outcomes {(1,1)(1,2)...(2,1)...(6,6)}

Step Rule of Counting - where |B| is unaffected by |A|
> $$ |A||B| = mn $$
