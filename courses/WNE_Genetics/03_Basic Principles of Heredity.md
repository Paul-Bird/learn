#####Â Example Red Hair
  
Why is red hair rare ?  

[melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_1_receptor) is one of the key proteins involved in regulating mammalian skin color and hair color.  

- [Eumelanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin#Eumelanin)
- [Pheomelanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin#Pheomelanin)  

When active the protein causes more eumelanin and less pheomelanin. When a human has a mutated MC1R they have red hair.
