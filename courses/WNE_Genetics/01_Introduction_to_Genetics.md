> Genetic information flows only in one direction, from DNA, to RNA, to protein, or RNA directly to protein.  

Human genome consists of around 20,000 genes, each of which is the instruction for building a protein.  

Selective farming that humans have done for thousands of years is in effect genetic experimentation.  

##### Role of Genetics

Some diseases can be diagnosed before any symptoms. Treatment can be personalised based on their DNA.  

[Huntington's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease) An incurable neurodegenerative disease that is mostly inherited. Mutated HTT gene is the cause.  

##### Model Organisms

- Short life cycle.
- Large numbers of progeny, can verify inherited traits.
- Special features, zebrafish have transparent embryos.

Golden mutant zebrafish has fewer [meanosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanosome), [SLC24A5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium/potassium/calcium_exchanger_5) gene also in humans.  

##### Gregor Mendel

1852 - [Cell theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_theory)  

Monk and Botanist between 1856 and 1863 studied seven characteristics of pea plants:
- plant height,
- pod shape and color,
- seed shape and color,
- flower position and color.

From these studies established notion of  "recessive" and "dominant" traits.  

1893 - Germ plasm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_plasm) 

1902 - [Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boveri%E2%80%93Sutton_chromosome_theory)  

1915 - [The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity](http://www.esp.org/books/morgan/mechanism/facsimile/)  

1966 - Moleculart translation of DNA sequences to protein.
