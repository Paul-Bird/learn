#####Â Cellular Reproduction

When one cell divides into two each new daughter cell must have an exact copy of the mother cell.

- Cytoplasm - divided evenly
- Orgenelles - divided evenly
- Nucleus - needs to duplicate

Nucleus contains the DNA

Eukaryotic cell

- Mitosis: Chromosome replication and division process.   
- Meiosis: one of each chromosome pair in the new gamete nucleus. 
- Have many chromosomes, each unique and essential.
- Histones to wrap DNA around to form [Nucleosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome)  
- Nucleosomes form [chromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin) loops of ~100,000 base pairs.  

Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus and only one chromosome. Cell division called [Binary Fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_(biology))    

Eukaryotic division
- Dissolve the nucleus.
- Replicate each chromosome.
- Make sure each side gets one of each chromosome copy.
- Form new nuclei.
- Cell divides.

No connection between number of chromosomes and complexity.

|Species|Chromosomes|

|Homo spaiens|46|
|[Mus musculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_mouse)|40|
|[Drosophila melanogaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster)|8|
|[Gallus gallus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl)|78|

Numbers in the table above are even as most Eukaryotes have each chromosome from each parent. [Diploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy)  


Parental variation of each chromosome, [allele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele).  

[Gametes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete) are made by meiosis and are [haploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy#Haploid_and_monoploid)  

Chromosomes just after replication, before cell division become tightly compacted, in this compacted state a chromosome has three parts:  
- [Centromere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere) joins  [Sister Chromatids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_chromatids) 
- [Telomere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere)
- [Origin of Replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_replication)

[Kinetochore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetochore) protein for seperating the sister chromatids.

##### Cell Cycle

- $G_0$ Normal activity
- $G_1$ Prepare to copy
- $G_1-S$ Checkpoint
- $S$ Sythesis
- $G_2$ Prepare for mitosis & [Cytokinesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokinesis)
- $G_2-M$ Checkpoint
- $M$ Mitosis finishing with Cytokinesis

All steps, other than Mitosis, are called [Interphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphase). 

Things that can go wrong

- DNA damage
- Viral infection
- Loss of ATP production

##### Interphase

Cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, replicates its DNA in preparation for mitosis, and conducts other "normal" cell functions.

[Cohesin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesin) protein complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion.  

##### Mitosis

1 [Prophase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophase)
- Condensation of chromosomes.
- Movement of [centrosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrosome).
- Formation of the mitotic spindle.
- Beginning of nucleoli breakdown.

2 [Prometaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometaphase)  
- Disintegration of the nuclear membrane
- Microtubles attach to the chromatids
- Microtubles lengthen and shorten pulling at the chromosome

3 [Metaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphase)
- Chromosomes are aligned from the Microtubial pulling.
- alignment is checked by equal tension at the centrosomes.

4 [Anaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphase)
- Cohesin disolves, chromosome splits.

5 [Telophase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telophase)
- Nuclear envelope is re-assembled.

6 [Cytokinesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokinesis)
- Cytoplasm divides, forming two cells
