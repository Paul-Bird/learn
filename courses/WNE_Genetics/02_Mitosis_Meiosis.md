#####Â Cellular Reproduction

When one cell divides into two each new daughter cell must have an exact copy of the mother cell.

- Cytoplasm - divided evenly
- Orgenelles - divided evenly
- Nucleus - needs to duplicate

Nucleus contains the DNA

Eukaryotic cell

- Mitosis: Chromosome replication and division process.   
- Meiosis: one of each chromosome pair in the new gamete nucleus. 
- Have many chromosomes, each unique and essential.
- Histones to wrap DNA around to form [Nucleosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome)  
- Nucleosomes form [chromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin) loops of ~100,000 base pairs.  

Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus and only one chromosome. Cell division called [Binary Fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_(biology))    

Eukaryotic division
- Dissolve the nucleus.
- Replicate each chromosome.
- Make sure each side gets one of each chromosome copy.
- Form new nuclei.
- Cell divides.

No connection between number of chromosomes and complexity.

Numbers in the table above are even as most Eukaryotes have each chromosome from each parent. [Diploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy)  


Parental variation of each chromosome, [allele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele).  

[Gametes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete) are made by meiosis and are [haploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy#Haploid_and_monoploid)  

Chromosomes just after replication, before cell division become tightly compacted, in this compacted state a chromosome has three parts:  
- [Centromere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere)  
- [Telomere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere)
- [Origin of Replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_replication)
