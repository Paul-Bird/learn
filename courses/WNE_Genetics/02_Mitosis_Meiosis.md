#####Â Cellular Reproduction

When one cell divides into two each new daughter cell must have an exact copy of the mother cell.

- Cytoplasm - divided evenly
- Orgenelles - divided evenly
- Nucleus - needs to duplicate

Nucleus contains the DNA

Eukaryotic cell

- Mitosis: Chromosome replication and division process.   
- Meiosis: one of each chromosome pair in the new gamete nucleus. 
- Have many chromosomes, each unique and essential.
- Histones to wrap DNA around to form [Nucleosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome)  
- Nucleosomes form [chromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin) loops of ~100,000 base pairs.  

Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus and only one chromosome. Cell division called [Binary Fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_(biology))  
In prokaryotes, [plectonemic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plectonemic) supercoils are predominant.  
  
  
Eukaryotic division
- Dissolve the nucleus.
- Replicate each chromosome.
- Make sure each side gets one of each chromosome copy.
- Form new nuclei.
- Cell divides.

No connection between number of chromosomes and complexity.

Numbers in the table above are even as most Eukaryotes have each chromosome from each parent. [Diploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy)  


Parental variation of each chromosome, [allele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele).  

[Gametes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete) are made by meiosis and are [haploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy#Haploid_and_monoploid)  

Chromosomes just after replication, before cell division become tightly compacted, in this compacted state a chromosome has three parts:  
- [Centromere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere) joins  [Sister Chromatids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_chromatids) 
- [Telomere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere)
- [Origin of Replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_replication)

[Kinetochore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetochore) protein for seperating the sister chromatids.

##### Cell Cycle

- $G_0$ Normal activity
- $G_1$ Prepare to copy
- $G_1-S$ Checkpoint
- $S$ Sythesis
- $G_2$ Prepare for mitosis & [Cytokinesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokinesis)
- $G_2-M$ Checkpoint
- $M$ Mitosis finishing with Cytokinesis

All steps, other than Mitosis, are called [Interphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphase). 

Things that can go wrong

- DNA damage
- Viral infection
- Loss of ATP production

##### Interphase

Cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, replicates its DNA in preparation for mitosis, and conducts other "normal" cell functions.

[Cohesin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesin) protein complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion.  

##### Mitosis

From a [Somatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_(biology)) cell.  

1 [Prophase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophase)
- Condensation of chromosomes.
- Movement of [centrosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrosome).
- Formation of the mitotic spindle.
- Beginning of nucleoli breakdown.

2 [Prometaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometaphase)  
- Disintegration of the nuclear membrane
- Microtubles attach to the chromatids
- Microtubles lengthen and shorten pulling at the chromosome

3 [Metaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphase)
- Chromosomes are aligned from the Microtubial pulling.
- alignment is checked by equal tension at the centrosomes.

4 [Anaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphase)
- Cohesin disolves, chromosome splits.

5 [Telophase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telophase)
- Nuclear envelope is re-assembled.

6 [Cytokinesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokinesis)
- Cytoplasm divides, forming two cells

#### Sexual Reproduction

Gametes fuse to create new life. The purpose of life is to reproduce, cells can reproduce. Meiosis allows for selective evolution to adapt to change.  

Two stages of Meiosis from a [Germ cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell):  
- Meiosis I: Reductive division, split pairs randomly into two cells with haploid number of chromosomes.
- Meiosis II: Four gamete cells with haploid number of chromosomes.

#### Meiosis I

[Prophase I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis#Prophase_I)  
- Chromosomes compact
- [Synapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapsis) Homologous chromosomes line up side by side.
- During synapsis four chromatids closely associated (group called a Tetrad).
- Geonome shuffling known as [Chromosomal Crossover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover) also see [Homologous recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_recombination) 

Metaphase I  
- Microtubules attach

Anaphase I  
- Chromosomes pull to opposite sides. Chromatides still attached.

Telophase I
- Reductive division  

#### [Interkinesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interkinesis)  
  
#### Meiosis II

Very much like Mitosis.  

Prophase II  
- spindles form and nuclear membranes breakdown

Metaphase II  
- Chromosomes line up in single file at the meta phase plate.  

Anaphase II  
- Chromatids are pulled to opposite sides.  

Telophase II  
- two new nuclei form and cells divide.  

#### Meiosis Summary

- Starting with one cell with 46 chromosomes.
- One replication, two cell divisions.
- We have four gamete cells each with 23 chromosomes.  

[Independent Assortment](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/heredity/mendelian-genetics-ap/a/the-law-of-independent-assortment#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20law%20of,allele%20received%20for%20another%20gene.)  

There are $2^23$ different possible combinations by mixing the parental chromosones for each gamete. In addition to the crossover that shuffles alleles.

Production of gametes in male animal is called [Spermatogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogenesis). When meiosis I is complete secondary spermatocytes are made. The product of meiosis II are spermatids.  

Production of gametes in female animal is called [oogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oogenesis). Cell division after meiosis I is unequal, one cell is considerably larger (the secondary oocyte) than the other (first polar body), by taking the majority of the cytoplasm and organelles.  
The secondary oocyte undergoes meiosis II, again most of the cytoplasm and organelles going to one copy. The larger cell is called the [ovum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_cell) a mature gamete. The smaller cell is the secondary polar body.
