### Bayesian Approach

Belief, what you think and how strongly.

- We have a prior belief
- Observe data
- Using data, update the belief

Posterior = Likelihood ร Prior รท Evidence  

Example:

Proportion of women in the population.

$x_1 ..., x_n \quad \text{bernoulli} (p) \quad p \in (0,1)$

The prior acts like one more observation.

For this example prior: 90% sure p is between 0.4 and 0.6, 95% between 0.3 and 0.8 etc.
